Hi, I’m **Miliad Farzian** — a 23-year-old backend developer who loves building tools, bots, and web apps.  
I learn best by creating projects, breaking things, and sharing what I figure out along the way.

### 👨‍💻 What I work with
- **Python** is my main language.  
- Frameworks I enjoy: **Django**, **FastAPI**, and **Flask**.  
- I use **PostgreSQL**, **Redis**, and **Celery** for data and background tasks.  
- Recently I’ve been experimenting a lot with **Cloudflare Workers** and serverless apps.  

### 🚀 Projects I’m proud of
- **TuneOn** — a platform for sharing tracks as playable links.  
- Telegram bots and APIs for real-time messaging and syncing.  
- Learning projects with **CI/CD**, **Docker**, and GitHub Actions to automate deployments.  

### 🎯 Why I write here
This blog is my place to:
- Document what I’m learning.  
- Share code snippets and experiments.  
- Reflect on bigger ideas (like secularism, self-growth, and technology’s impact).  

### 🌱 Outside of code
I enjoy diving back into **mathematics** (relearning step by step), exploring philosophy, and challenging myself with deep self-reflection. Writing here is also part of that journey.
